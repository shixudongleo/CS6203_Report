Video lifelog is becoming more and more popular. The amount of videos recorded
is rapidly increasing, however, applications that make use of these datas are
severly lacking. Current computer vision applications use a small number of
input images/videos because of the difficulty in aquiring computational
resources and storage options for large amounts of
data~\cite{2005_TSMC_Guo, 2010_KDD_White}. This work explores video lifelog
using big data framework. The works of image and video processing using big data
framework are provided as an overview of existing works in computer vision
community.
