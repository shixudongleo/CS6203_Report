\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:sec_conclusion}
The growth in popularity of lifelog and personal recording devices has resulted
the vast amount of video and image collected daily, there is the need to
processing them efficiently. Processing visual lifelog present challenges in
analysis and store in a form with enable user to retrieved easily and extract
useful information. We have designed an approach for processing large amount of
videos on current big data platform. We also implemented a people counting
problem as a case study. Experiment result shows that our application
achieved good accuracy and promising performance with speedup of 5 comparing to
traditional approach - frame-base Matlab application. Although we have reduce
overhead of Matlab by using cross compile and increase granularity of input,
more research is needed to minimize this cost and also to support for other types of computation.
